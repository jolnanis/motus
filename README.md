# motus
Motus was a french TV game show based on american TV show Lingo.

## Motivation
My roommate wasn't convinced that a script would outplay a human at this game, this project started in 2018 as a Jupyter notebook to prove him wrong. While it took only 6 hours to disprove my roommate, I am now using some of my free time to build a better console-based version of the game.

## Advancement
So far only the french wordlist (dictionary) and some related manipulation routines have been built.
